This is a repository for the Udacity Sensor Fusion Nano Degree projects 
that I have been worked on during the learning. 

There are 4 projects:
* Lidar Obstacle Detection
* Lidar Camera Fusion on Total Time to Collide
* Radar Target Detection
* Unscented Kalman Filter Estimation

Dependencies: 
* Point Cloud Library PCL 1.8 https://pointclouds.org/downloads/ (PCL 1.11 might fail with VTK)
* Eigen 3.3.9 https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/ 
* OpenCV 4.5.1 https://docs.opencv.org/4.5.1/df/d65/tutorial_table_of_content_introduction.html The OpenCV 4.1.0 source code can be found [here](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/4.1.0)
* YOLOv3 https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3
