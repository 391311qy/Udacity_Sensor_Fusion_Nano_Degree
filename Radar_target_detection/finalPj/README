FMCW Waveform Design

CRITERIA
MEETS SPECIFICATIONS
Using the given system requirements, design
a FMCW waveform. Find its Bandwidth (B), chirp time (Tchirp) and slope of the chirp.

For given system requirements the calculated slope should be around 2e13

=======
Answer:
Bandwidth B is found to be 1.5e8 Hz = c / (2* res)
Tchirp here is found to be 7.33e-6 s
slope = 2.0455e13.
=======

Simulation Loop

CRITERIA
MEETS SPECIFICATIONS
Simulate Target movement and calculate the beat or mixed signal for every timestamp.

A beat signal should be generated such that once range FFT implemented, it gives the correct range i.e the initial position of target assigned with an error margin of +/- 10 meters.

=======
Answer:
The mix signal is the elementwise multiplication bY Tx and Rx. Here the calculation of range is by range: displacement = velocity * time, and the time delay is calculated as the time of light traversal for a round trip to target. 2* rt /c. Initial velocity is defined to be +15m/s and target initial range is set at 75m.
=======

Range FFT (1st FFT)

CRITERIA
MEETS SPECIFICATIONS
Implement the Range FFT on the Beat or Mixed Signal and plot the result.

A correct implementation should generate a peak at the correct range, i.e the
initial position of target assigned with an error margin of +/- 10 meters.

=======
Answer:
fft result is shown in 1D (1st row of the data) and 2D surface plot was implemented. A peak can be seen in both 1D and 2D plot.
=======

2D CFAR

CRITERIA
MEETS SPECIFICATIONS
Implement the 2D CFAR process on the output of 2D FFT operation, i.e the Range Doppler Map.

The 2D CFAR processing should be able to suppress the noise and separate
the target signal. The output should match the image shared in walkthrough.

Create a CFAR README File

In a README file, write brief explanations for the following:

Implementation steps for the 2D CFAR process.
Selection of Training, Guard cells and offset.
Steps taken to suppress the non-thresholded cells at the edges.

=======
Answer:
2D CFAR was implemented following the prompts with following parameters: 3 doppler training cells and 10 range training cells, 2 guard cells for both dimensions. Offset of 5 dB to construct the threshold. For each iteration CUT cell, we take the noise level as the average value of the db2pow(signal) around it's training cells. I further added the noise level with the offset. After comparing the signal value with the calculated threshold, ones that bigger than threshold was normalized to 1, otherwise 0. 

Additionally, by initializing a 2D matrix with zeros everywhere, we removed the noise that are around the edge of the RDM matrix. Finally, the plot should be generated for the result after CFAR.
